Created a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

For Testing the website used Protractor.

It is an automation testing tool for web applications testing which combines powerful technologies such as Jasmine, Selenium Webdriver, Node. js etc. 


Automation Testing is helpful than Manual Testing as:
* Faster Feedback.
* Less number of people.
* Reusability of Automated Tests.
* Reliabilty.
* Bugs --> Automation helps you find bugs in the early stages of software development.
